# MySql-Music-Project
Project as part of CFG 8 week data & SQL course
This porject sets out a database to store a catalogue of music artists in the following tables:
Artist
Genre
Album
Discography
On_Tour
Tour_location.

I have created different views and queries to assess the data and a function to establish how many years also an album was released.

Also included is a data base diagram document to show the relationships between the tables.
